# Calculator

A simple calculator written in vanilla JavaScript with a sort-of functional programming style. Currently uses an eval() to do the heavy lifting, with some helper functions to prevent operator buttons from being pressed twice in a row or clicked before a number.

## To do

- Make the website keyboard and screen reader accessible
- Add a helper function to remove octal literals (010 becomes 10, 020 becomes 20, etc...).
- Make the site responsive for all devices.
